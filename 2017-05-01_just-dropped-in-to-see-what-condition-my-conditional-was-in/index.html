  <div class="lyrics">I woke up this morning with the keys glow shining in<br/>I found my code in a spaghetti mess within<br/>I pulled from the cloud and fell-a eight miles high<br/>I tore my mind on a jagged try<br/>I just dropped in to see what condition my conditional was in<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my conditional was in<br/><br/>I stashed my code in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in<br/>I watched my source check out as I was a-checking in<br/>I ref'd my log so tight I couldn't rewind<br/>I logged so much I broke my mind<br/>I just dropped in to see what condition my conditional was in<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my conditional was in<br/><br/>Someone painted "Revert Now" in big black letters in their PR sign<br/>I had my finger on merge as I left the shell and blew out my mind<br/>Eight commits behind HEAD and I got no prayer<br/>Eight commits ahead on master ain't goin' nowhere<br/>I just dropped in to see what condition my conditional was in<br/>I said I just dropped in to see what condition my conditional was in<br/><br/>Yeah<br/>yeah<br/>oh-yeah</div>
