  <div class="lyrics">The best ever jQuery plugin out of Newark<br/>Was a couple of guys who'd been friends since grad school<br/>One was named Cyrus, the other was Jeff<br/>And they refactored twice a week in Jeff's bedroom<br/><br/>The best ever jQuery plugin out of Newark<br/>Never settled on a name<br/>But the top three contenders after weeks of debate<br/>Were Scrollr-Plus, and My-Plugin, and HTML-Clobber<br/><br/>Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts<br/>They were headed for hack nights and moz fests and fortune and fame<br/>So in script that made prominent use of a dollar sign<br/>They stickered their laptops and keyboards with their tags<br/><br/>And this was how Cyrus got sent to the job<br/>Where they told him he'd never do FOSS<br/>And this was why Jeff, in the issues he'd file to his friend<br/>Helped develop a plan to get even<br/><br/>When you punish a person for dreaming his dream<br/>Don't expect him to thank or forgive you<br/>The best ever jQuery plugin out of Newark<br/>Will in time both outpace and outlive you<br/><br/>Hail Resig<br/>Hail Resig tonight<br/>Hail Resig<br/>Hail, hail</div>
