  <div class="lyrics">April is the cruelest month, kneading<br/>Knuckles onto keys, mixing<br/>Cases and conventions, stirring<br/>Dull roots that need sudo to brew.<br/>Winter kept us warm, covering<br/>Laps in heat sinks, feeding<br/>A little life a few volts a time.<br/>Summer surprised us, coming over the Hudson<br/>With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade<br/>And went on in the sunlight, into the High-line park,<br/>And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br/>Bin gar keine Zeichner, stamm' aus Nachricht-Apps, echt Journalismus<br/>And when we were interns, seeing the mayor's,<br/>They took us shredding<br/>And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br/>Marie, hold on tight. And down papers went.<br/>In the mountains, there you feel free.<br/>I code, much of the night, and go south in the winter.<br/><br/>What are the roots that access the shell, what branches grow<br/>Out of this stony repo? Son of Octocat,<br/>You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br/>A heap of broken aliases, where the path is faulty,<br/>And the dead tree cries four-ô-four, the reset --hard gives no relief,<br/>And the dry prompt blinking blinking, ready to tell you nothing was found. Only<br/>There is a shadow to this blinking prompt<br/>(Come in under the shadow of this blinking prompt),<br/>And I will show you something different from either<br/>The path in your shell pointing to your bash<br/>Or the path in your the shell rising to zsh;<br/>I will you show you news in a handful of binary.<br/>Frisch weht der Wind<br/>Der anderer Weg zu,<br/>Meine Schreiberzukunft<br/>Wo weilest du?<br/>"You gave me Mountain Lion first a year ago;<br/>They called me Mountain Lion girl."<br/>--Yet when I booted up, late, from the Apple garden,<br/>Your arms full, and your lips pursed, I could not scroll,<br/>My gestures reversed, I was neither<br/>hosting Sites nor at the beach, but beach balls spin,<br/>Looking into the heart of rainbow's underworld twirling, the stillness.<br/>Öd und leer der Windrad<br/><br/>Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br/>Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br/>Is known to have the most abstract library in Europe,<br/>With a wicked pack of functions. Here, said she,<br/>Is your function, the drownedPhoenicianSailor<br/>```<br/>function (hisEyes) {<br/>  var pearls = hisEyes.toPearls()<br/>  return pearls;<br/>}<br/>```<br/>Here is Belladonna() // the Lady of the Rocks,<br/>// The lady of situations.<br/>Here is theManWithThreePipes(), and here theHowLoop(),<br/>And here is theOneCommasCsv(), and this noop,<br/>Which is blank, is something it extends,<br/>Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find<br/>theHangingLine(). Fear death by heap size.<br/>I see crowds of memory, doubling every 18 months.<br/>Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,<br/>Tell her I bring the drive myself:<br/>One must be so careful these days.<br/><br/>Unreal City,<br/>Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br/>A crowd flowed over Brooklyn Bridge, so many,<br/>I had not thought Maps had misdirected so many,<br/>Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br/>And each one fixed his eyes before his screen.<br/>Flowed up the hill and down Old Fulton Street,<br/>To where Grimaldi's kept the hours<br/>With a dead line on the stroke of them all.<br/>There I saw one I knew and stopped him, crying "Stetson!<br/>You who were with me in the /etc at Etsy!<br/>That worm you planted last year in the root,<br/>Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br/>Or has sudden vigilance disturbed its bed?<br/><br/>Oh keep the logs far hence, that'll reduce it to text,<br/>With its reductions it'll dig it up!<br/>You! hypocrite codeur! mon semblable, --mon frère!</div>
