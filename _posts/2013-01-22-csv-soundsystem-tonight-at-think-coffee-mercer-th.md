It's twenty degrees out but it's always blaringly hot at Think.

This has been a busy couple of weeks and our prose and verse have
taken the real brunt of it. In lieu of rhymes, I'll share a favorite
story by Harlan Ellison. It was recently turned into an unfortunate
movie starring Justin Timberlake. But the original story itself is
good and written with style.

"Repent Harlequin!" Said the Ticktock Man
