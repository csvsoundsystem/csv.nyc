title: csv soundsystem, back again with more Tuesdays
---


This is a heads up that starting this week, csv soundsystem will be going back to every Tuesday at 6:45 instead of every Wednesday. We'll be sending out the reminder emails every Monday. Poem / song suggestions are welcome since Brian and I are close to running out of ideas by now.

Also, as a community announcement the Innovation Showcase is happening at the Columbia J-School today (Saturday) from 12 - 4. Here's the full info.

Innovation Showcase 2013
On Saturday May 18th, 2013, from 12pm – 4pm, Columbia Journalism School will be hosting its second Innovation Showcase, a public open house designed to introduce the larger community to the original and innovative reporting and publishing work being done at the school.

Dozens of works across all forms of media will be on view, and project creators will be on hand to discuss their work. We hope you will take this opportunity to visit the school, see what's new in the world of journalism, and share your thoughts with us. We look forward to seeing you!
