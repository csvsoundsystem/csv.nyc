This week: Pulp's "Comma People"

She came to J-School with a thirst for data.
She went to Susan's tutorial at Strata.
That's where I,
Caught her eye.
She told me that excel was drama.
I said "In that case, 'awk dash F quote comma'."
She said "Fine."
And in thirty milliseconds time,
She said,

"I want to live like comma people,
I want to do whatever comma people do,
I want to code with comma people,
I want to code with comma people, like you."
Well what else could i do? - I said "I'll add you to the google group"

I took her to a media start up.
I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere,
so it started there.
I said pretend you cant use D3.
She just laughed and said,
"Oh you're so funny."
I said "yeah?
Well I can't see anyone rendering SVG in here"

Are you sure you want to live like comma people
you want to speak however comma people speak
you want to hack with comma people
you want to hack with comma people
like me
But she was kind of out of wits, 
she just smiled and read my gists

Rent a server in the cloud.
Tweet some articles on Tow.
Style some divs and push repos.
Pretend you never use S.O.
But still you'll never get it right
Cause when you're hacking late at night
watching errors fill your log
if you paid MTurkers they could do your job

You'll never code like the comma people.
You'll never do whatever comma people do.
You'll never live like comma people.
You'll never watch your tuesdays slip out view,
and hack at think with brews.
because there's nothing better to do.
