Last week saw
Julian guffaw
At my use so grave
of no trim_trailing_white_space_on_save
Thomas so productive
and instructive
had a computer
No more giant art pad in pewter
The quiche stale
the crust pale
Mint tea great
Much we ate
And much was done!
At least one pun!
Yet still much to do
Join us, won't you?
