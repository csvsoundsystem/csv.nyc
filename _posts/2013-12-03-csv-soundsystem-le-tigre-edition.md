Every day and night
Every day and night
I can see your requests requests, hits are suckin power out the hive mind
I'm outta time, I'm outta fuckin time
Your app is so glut, cloggin all the pipelines, but
Wanna resize? Wanna see me resize?
Watch me scale up in practically no time
One, two, three, four
You got what you been asking for
With your private id and your terminal shell, see everything I see
And everything I feel is alright,
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

You check the logs now watch me get you hot
Your just in char-set when your screaming
And your shouting "less errors please, less errors please"
You want what you want but you don't really know all your needs
Who does your, your data layer?

Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?
Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?

You bought a new rack, your first series-A stack
"At scale" but I really gotta say "stop"
Because I'm so core that I could outperform
Even with a stupid fuckin Dell Pentium board, Dell Pentium board
Your servers are dumb like a Dell Pentium board
I'll walk on it
I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it, walking one, two
Who? Who? Who? Who?

Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?
Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?
