title: csv soundsystem, tomorrow with Girl Develop It! in the Woolworth Building
---


As we did back in august, csv is joining up with Girl Develop It! (courtesy of Aurelia) and meeting this week in the Woolworth building, whose lobby is so beautiful you're not allowed to photograph it, in the offices of Control Group, whose hallways are like a real-world Bond level. It will go from 7 to 9:30 sharp. 

If you're planning on coming, shoot aurelia an email (xxxxxxxx@gmail.com) to get added to the security list. 

Join us, won't you?

Go here to peruse project ideas: [GDI Code Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuDay9KcwU4YdFVlVzVpTm9VdkRtanFwQ1UwbXljeWc#gid=0)

This google doc hosts a bunch of resources for playing with new
languages, as well as the relevant links for the TurntableFM, project
ideas, and a calendar. Feel free to add to it and edit. As per the
Occupy Hackathon this weekend, and a few other projects, I've added a
Data section for anyone interested in working with large data sets or
making use of government data.

Here is the Turntable FM link for our music crowd sourcing:

This month we have some new open datasets to play with (see google doc
above) and a panel of rad TAs and visitors for speed mentoring
sessions (we'll have some IOS devs on hand to help, plus cameos from
NY Tech Meetup and GDI). So bring your ideas and nascent projects to
discuss with other female devs and entrepreneurs in the NY area.
