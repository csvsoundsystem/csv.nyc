title: csv soundsystem, The Passion Pit Abstraction Layer Edition
---


Post-holidays, we're back to Tuesdays at 6:45pm at Whynot Coffee & Wine in the West Village, which will be our regular meeting time and place. We have officially left Think Coffee. It had a good run but this new location has better wifi and is usually less crowded. They have two locations so be careful not to end up in the east village. Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whynot-coffee-and-wine-new-york

We usually stay till around 9 or 10 so if you have any kind of project you want to work on around other folks who might be able to lend a hand or whom you could just chat with, we'll be there.

Join us, won't you?

This week's song is an abstraction layer over Passion Pit's Sleepyhead. Think of it like Esperanto but with less of a one-to-one semantic relationship to other languages or like baby-babble but with more of a beat.
