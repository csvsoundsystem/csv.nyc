title: csv soundsystem tonight + Treasury.IO launch party & hack night Thursday
---


csv soundsystem will take place at the normal time and place tonight, 6:45pm Think Coffee at Mercer + 4th. 

And this Thursday, we're having a launch party and hack night to test Treasury.io that a few of us have been working on under a grant from Knight-Mozilla OpenNews.

In short, we built an API for the U.S. Treasury's daily data feeds that document government spending and borrowing and you can do a lot of interesting stuff with it. Come by Thursday at 7 to see how it works or suggest features.

RSVP and location info here: http://treasuryio.eventbrite.com/

There will be beer and pizza, no quiche.

Join us, won't you?
