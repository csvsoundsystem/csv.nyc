We hope you've all weathered the storm. If you want to lend your tech

We'll be resuming csv this week, today, Tuesday, as it were, at the
normal time of 645 at Think Coffee, Mercer + 4th.

Brian is flying in from MozFest Tuesday night where he was recently
crowned a 2012 Knight News Fellow at the New York Times, what Joe
Biden would call a bfd.

He even has his own tag on Nieman Lab

Read the article if you have a moment. The third to last graf before
the "Injecting coding culture into newsrooms" section
(ante-penultimate, if you will) is particularly good.

Join us, wont you?
