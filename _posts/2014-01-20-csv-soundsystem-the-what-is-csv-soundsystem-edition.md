A shifting cast of characters meet in the downstairs Jazz Room (where there so far hasn't been any actual jazz) at Whynot Coffee at Christopher and Gay Streets starting around 6:45pm until 11pm every Tuesday.

We also usually write these reminder emails with a song or poem whose lyrics have been changed into something journalism or programming related. They take some time to write so sometimes we don't have one -- like this week because parents are visiting. We feel really bad each time we don't include a poem. If you would like to write one, contact Michael or Brian.

We also end each email with this line, because traditions are grand and it's also kind of a SQL-pun:
