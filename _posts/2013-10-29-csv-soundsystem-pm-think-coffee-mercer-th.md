It's the Markov life for us
It's the Markov life for us
Instead of tweeting, we just twit
Instead of trolling, we write scripts
It's the Markov life!

From startin' out my random walkin'
Transition only to the terms a word has even seen 
To dropping some of the hottest phrases Twitter's ever heard
From the tweet bots and Ebooks - it ain't a dying meme
You know me well...
From late nights in a trolling spell, my only hell
is when Twitter blocks my g-mail, Fuck naw!
where all my hackers with the python scripts, make bots!
And if you with me Andrey, get stochastic, and what-not
I'm from the school of the Markovs, you must not
Let outsiders call us 'spam bots', and my plot
slice up the corpus, split it 50/50, uh-huh
And take the model, train it real pretty, uh-huh
A drunkard's walk - I get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely, no memory, I just transition quickly, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of horse_ebooks, baby, Volume 2, y'all trolls get ready

It's the Markov life for us
It's the Markov life for us
Instead of tweeting, we just twit
Instead of trolling, we write scripts
It's the Markov life!
