We'll be meeting again at Think Coffee, mercer & 4th, there seems to be more space towards the front than in the back so look around if you don't see us. I'll be working on d3 force layouts, Marc & Anna may be doing olympics stuff? and Julian perhaps we'll get to code the 8-bit soundtrack to new york. maybe.

To cut down on email, I made a google group: http://bit.ly/Nmchsj
