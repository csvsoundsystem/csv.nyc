This week, "Don't Lie" by Vampire Weekend re-imagined as a conversation between an obsessive Mechanical Turker and their would-be significant other who is trying to break the addiction.

News peg: The release of [Transcribable](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/transcribable-free-the-files-to-go), which you should all check out.

Join us, won't you?

One click sends cents all around
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need transcriptions inbound
So serve me more my baby

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
AWS Turks die young, is he ready to go?
It's my last time running this form
But the drinks are free and the button is bold.

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of the ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

Young turks, young Saturday nights
Young eyes shouldn't stare just at bytes
Old flames to exist must ignite
So close the screen my baby

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
Got high HIT now all tasks are gold
It's my last time running this form
But the drinks are free and the button is bold.

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of the ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And every Turk I know

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
AWS Turks die young, is he ready to go?
It's not the last time running this form
Cause the hires come fast and friction is low.

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of the ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And every Turk I know
