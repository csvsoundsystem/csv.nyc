`Twas fixed, and the slithy widths
  Did gyre and gimble in the text file:
All mimsy were the headers,
  And the file paths outdated.

"Beware the Fixiewock, my son!
  The line endings that bite, the indentations that catch!
Beware the Footnote bird, and shun
  The frumious Text-to-columns-snatch!"

He took his parsal Python in hand:
  Long time the .txt foe he sought --
So rested he by the Regular Expression tree,
  And stood awhile in UltraEdit.

And, as in CSVish thought he stood,
  The Fixiewock, with special characters of lame,
Came whiffling through the hacky scraper,
  And errbled as it came! 

One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The parsal script went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its output
  He went piping back.

"And, has thou slain the Fixiewock?
  Come to my arms, my tired boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
  He exclamation-separated his values in his joy.

`Twas fixed, and the slithy widths
  Did gyre and gimble in the text file:
All mimsy were the headers,
  And the file paths outdated.

Join us, won't you?
