Last week we broke double digits and successfully occupied the back corner.  Turns out we are successful colonizers as well as coders.  

Some exciting things:

Tom made an awesome logo: http://chainsaw.thomaslevine.com/csv.svg,
(free quiche to whoever can make an R plot of the iris data that matches this color scheme)

http://www.ecohacknyc.org/ is happening in november...you should go! 
last time I made a viz of a little kid scribbling on a map:

Other much cooler things were made too.

A lot of people were at ONA12. Excited to hear how it went!
