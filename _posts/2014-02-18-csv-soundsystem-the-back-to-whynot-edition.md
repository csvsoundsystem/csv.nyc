This week we'll be at Whynot Coffee & Wine in the West Village from about 6:45 to 11pm. They say there shouldn't be any band there tonight, so we'll be in the downstairs jazz room.

They're at Christopher & Gay Streets. Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whynot-coffee-and-wine-new-york

They have two locations so be careful not to end up in the east village.

Join us, won't you?
