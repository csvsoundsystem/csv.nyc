We're meeting at the normal time this week, 6:45pm at the Think Coffee on Mercer + 4th Streets. Mike Tigas will be joining us again to help people with encryption tools he went over at Hacks / Hackers last week.

If you weren't able to attend or didn't download the software, Mike's put up a step-by-step: https://github.com/hackshackers/hhnyc-crypto/blob/master/tipsheet.md

Best to download all the software before you come.

I Wanna Hack With Somebody - Whitney Houston feat. Brian + Michael

Ah
Yeah
Wooo!

Hey-ya
Ha
Hoo-ya
Aha
Yeah
I want to hack

Mac clicks into the power
As the battery begins to fade
Not enough time to figure out
How best to load this page
I've done alright up 'til now
Stack overflow shows me how
When sqlite stalls,
Low-level code calls

[Chorus:] x2
Oh! I wanna hack with somebody
Control-alt-delete with somebody
Yeah! I wanna hack with somebody 
With somebody who loves C

I’ve been in love and lost my senses
Spinning servers up and down
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I get kicked off the cloud
I need a clan maybe in finance
Who can teach me to utilize my RAM
When sqlite stalls
Low-level code calls

[Chorus:]
Oh! I wanna hack with somebody
I wanna be 1337 with somebody
Yeah! I wanna hack with somebody 
With somebody who loves C

Oh! I wanna hack with somebody
I wanna autocomplete...
Yeah! I wanna hack with somebody 
With somebody who loves C

Somebody hoo! Somebody hoo!
Somebody who loves C yeah!
Somebody hoo! Somebody hoo!
Controlling server farms, oh
I need a clan maybe in finance
Who can teach me to utilize my RAM
When sqlite stalls
Low-level code calls

Oh, I wanna hack with somebody
I wanna live tweet with somebody
Yeah, I wanna hack with somebody
With somebody who loves C
Oh, I wanna hack with somebody
I wanna gcc with somebody
Yeah, I wanna hack with somebody
With somebody who loves C

Ooh--ooh hoooo
