This week, in honor of our can't-decide-if-it's-going-to-be-warm-out weather

April is the cruelest month, kneading<br/>
Knuckles onto keys, mixing<br/>
Cases and conventions, stirring<br/>
Dull roots that need sudo to brew.<br/>
Winter kept us warm, covering<br/>
Laps in heat sinks, feeding<br/>
A little life a few volts a time.<br/>
Summer surprised us, coming over the Hudson<br/>
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade<br/>
And went on in the sunlight, into the High-line,<br/>
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br/>
Bin gar keine Zeichner, stamm' aus Nachricht-Apps, echt Journalismus<br/>
And when we were interns, seeing the mayor's,<br/>
They took us shredding<br/>
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br/>
Marie, hold on tight. And down papers went.<br/>
In the mountains, there you feel free.<br/>
I code, much of the night, and go south in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
What are the roots that access the shell, what branches grow<br/>
Out of this stony repository? Son of Octocat,<br/>
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br/>
A heap of broken images, where the path is faulty,<br/>
And the dead tree cries four-ô-four, the reset --hard gives no relief,<br/>
And the dry prompt blinking blinking, ready to tell you nothing was found. Only<br/>
There is a path under this blinking prompt<br/>
(Come in under the path of this blinking prompt),<br/>
And I will show you something different from either<br/>
Your path from the shell striding to your package <br/>
Or your path on the client raising your asset;<br/>
I will you show you news in a handful of binary.<br/>
Frisch weht der Wind<br/>
Der anderer Weg zu,<br/>
Meine Schreiberzukunft<br/>
Wo weilest du?<br/>
"You gave me Mountain Lion first a year ago;<br/>
They called me Mountain Lion girl."<br/>
--Yet when I booted up, late, from the Apple garden,<br/>
Your arms full, and your lips pursed, I could not scroll,<br/>
My gestures reversed, I was neither <br/>
hosting Sites nor at the beach, but beach balls spin,<br/>
Looking into the heart of rainbow's underworld twirling, the stillness.<br/>
Öd und leer der Windrad<br/>

Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br/>
Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br/>
Is known to have the most abstract library in Europe,<br/>
With a wicked pack of functions. Here, said she,<br/>
Is your function, the drownedPhoenicianSailor(his_eyes){<br/>
window.your_eyes.focus(this);<br/>
var pearls = his_eyes.toPearls();<br/>
return pearls;<br/>
}
Here is Belladonna() // the Lady of the Rocks,<br/>
// The lady of situations.<br/>
Here is theManWithThreePipes(), and here theHowLoop(),<br/>
And here is theOneCommasCSV(), and this function,<br/>
Which is blank, is something it extends,<br/>
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find<br/>
theHangingLine(). Fear death by heap size.<br/>
I see crowds of memory, doubling every 18 months.<br/>
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,<br/>
Tell her I bring the drive myself:<br/>
One must be so careful these days.<br/>
<br/>
Unreal City,<br/>
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br/>
A crowd flowed over Brooklyn Bridge, so many,<br/>
I had not thought Maps had misdirected so many,<br/>
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br/>
And each one fixed his eyes before his screen.<br/>
Flowed up the hill and down Old Fulton Street,<br/>
To where Grimaldi's kept the hours<br/>
With a dead line on the stroke of them all.<br/>
There I saw one I knew and stopped him, crying "Stetson!<br/>
You who were with me in the /etc at Etsy!<br/>
That worm you planted last year in the root,<br/>
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br/>
Or has sudden vigilance disturbed its bed?<br/>
<br/>
Oh keep the logs far hence, that'll reduce it to text,<br/>
With its reductions it'll dig it up!<br/>
You! hypocrite codeur! mon semblable, --mon frère!<br/>
