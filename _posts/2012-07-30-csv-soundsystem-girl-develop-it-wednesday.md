title: csv soundsystem + girl develop it wednesday
---


csv soundsystem is merging this week with Girl Develop It, a meetup
group for ladies who code, organized this week by my friend Aurelia.
It's at her office at Control Group, 233 Broadway in the Woolworth
building (fancy). It starts at about 7. And, I dare say, they're group
is a bit more numerous than ours since 60 people have rsvp'd. Let me
know if you're planning on coming and I'll slip a list of names to
Aurelia who will give it to security etc.

Here's the link with the info for this week:

Next week, Aug 8th, we'll be back to Think Coffee, 6:45. Mercer + 4th.
