hey all,

last week we did good by the comma and won best in show at the New York Times science fair - http://tech.gilt.com/post/56819208172/baking-soda-volcanoes-need-not-apply-highlights-from.

This week, D.R.E.A.M. by the group that also inspired our organizational philosophy:

data rules everything around me, D.R.E.A.M.
get the memory, giga gigabytes y'all

I grew up on them text files, default Excel styles,
using BDAM was no jam,
so little RAM, comp froze on man man,
so then I moved Cloud-land,
a young youth, letting my scripts loose, error proof,
only way I began a day off was map-reduce
and let's awk it like this son, greping on this one and that one
pulling out stats for fun
But it was just a dream for a screen, a data fiend
Started scraping sites at sixteen
and firing up Hbase, calculate page-rank,
reduce dimensions of the feature space
no question I could see, P of A given B,
but the proofs made my eyes bleed.
and no question I would seek it all to make n equal all,
Slicing up DBs with SQL calls,
But life got no better, same damn old measures,
Insights are rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with some sick journalists and went all out
Catching leaks from agencies,
FOIA'n for DB's, every week we went to csv,
so open command line, or fire up sublime,
g-git-POW, and join us, wont you now?
