  <div class="title">Now You're Just Somebody That I Used to You (Now You're Just Somebody That I Used to Know)</div>
  
  <div class="linerNotes">This week's song, Gotye (feat. Kimbra) with "Somebody that I used to Yo." A song about navigating digital-age relationships, which are often mediated through apps and other platforms that dictate the terms and channels of communication.

The protagonist has been cut out from Kimbra's life because he has not kept up the pace of adoption â€” partly because he finds the level of information these apps require as being too invasive.</div>

  <div class="lyrics">Now and then I think when all we had was Friendster<br/>Like logging on you felt so creepy you could spy<br/>Told myself that it wasn't right for me<br/>But felt so lonely without company<br/>But that was love and it's an ache I still remember<br/><br/>You can get addicted to a certain kind of closeness<br/>Like fascination with a trend, always a trend<br/>So when you found that I could not keep up<br/>Well you said that we would still be friends<br/>But I'll admit that I just knew that it was over<br/><br/>But you didn't have to cut me off<br/>Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br/>And I don't even need your love<br/>But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br/>No I won't be signing up for Lo<br/>Have your friends collect your records and then see you slumber<br/><br/>I guess that I don't need that though<br/>Now you're just somebody that I used to Yo<br/><br/>Now you're just somebody that I used to Yo<br/>Now you're just somebody that I used to Yo<br/><br/><br/>Now and then I think of all the times you missed my postings<br/>But had me believing it was always something your phone'd done<br/>But I don't wanna relive my rave<br/>Telling you every place I fave<br/>You let your inner Luddite show<br/>And I'll never get all hung up on somebody that I used to Yo<br/><br/>But you didn't have to cut me off<br/>Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br/>And I don't even need your love<br/>But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br/>No I won't be signing up for Lo<br/>Have your friends collect your records and then see you slumber<br/><br/>I guess that I don't need that though<br/>Now that there's Somebody there's no use for Yo<br/><br/>Somebody<br/>(No use for Yo)<br/>Somebody<br/>(Now that there's Somebody there's no use for Yo)<br/><br/>Somebody<br/>(No use for Yo)<br/>Somebody<br/>(Now that there's Somebody there's no use for Yo)<br/><br/>(No use for Yo)<br/>(There's no use for Yo)<br/>(No use for Yo)<br/>Somebody</div>
