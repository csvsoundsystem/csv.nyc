  <div class="title">Won't you merge my fork (Welcome to New York)</div>
  
  <div class="linerNotes">this week is auspicious in csvmail history for reasons that will become clear over the next thirteen weeks. it started when taylor swift came to the brooklyn bridge park last week to hang out with us and dropped some rare cuts and japanese imports no one had ever heard before.

with her permission, here's an early draft "Won't You Merge My Fork?", which is a about the life of someone who searches projects for security vulnerabilities and fixes them via pull request.

It's the first song off her new album "WGS 1984". She also shared some rare album cover art. so rad. unfortunately she didn't put this video on the youtube so just hum along in your head is what she recommended.</div>
