  <div class="linerNotes">A 90s classic and the first band i ever saw in concert touring this album: weezer's "proxy folly" about the troubles being behind a corporate proxy and trying to get qgis to load its plugin repositories. halfway through the song, the team goes rogue but is chased down by IT who resort to further lengths to implement network security.</div>
