  <div class="lyrics">I was working in the lab, late one night<br/>When my eyes beheld an eerie sight<br/>For my monster from his slab, began to rise<br/>And suddenly to my surprise<br/><br/>He did the bash, he did the monster bash<br/>The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash<br/>He did the bash, new lines end in a slash<br/>He did the bash, he did the monster bash<br/><br/>From my laboratory near the castle's vane<br/>To the master bedroom, where the AIs train<br/>The neurals all came from their humble abodes<br/>To get a jolt from my electrodes<br/><br/>They did the bash, they did the monster bash<br/>The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash<br/>He did the bash, it will catch on more than flash<br/>He did the bash, he did the monster bash<br/><br/>The oh-my-zsh-ers were having fun, the party began to uncork<br/>The guests included *Man, Tabula and its forks<br/><br/>The scene was rockin', all were piping in sounds<br/>Igor on a shell, running in background<br/>The Bitwise Bangers were about to debut<br/>With their vocal group, "The Binary 10"<br/><br/>They did the bash, they wrote in monster bash<br/>The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash<br/>They did the bash, new lines end in a slash<br/>They did the bash, they played the monster bash<br/><br/>Chiming from a window, Tabby's bell did ring<br/>Seems he was troubled by just one thing<br/>He crawled off the screen and shook his fist<br/>And said, "Whatever happened to my Terminal twist?"<br/><br/>It's now the bash, it's now the monster bash<br/>The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash<br/>They did the bash, new lines end in a slash<br/>It's the now bash, it's now the monster bash<br/><br/>Now everything's cool, Tab's a part of the band<br/>And my monster bash is the hit of the land<br/>For you, the living, this bash was meant too<br/>When you get to my door, tell them Model A sent you<br/><br/>Then you can bash, then you can monster bash<br/>The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash<br/>Then you can bash, it will catch on more than flash<br/>Then you can bash, then you can monster bash</div>
