  <div class="lyrics">Let us type then, you and I,<br/>When the cells are spread out across our eye<br/>As our object's melted into a table.<br/>Let us go, through certain half-converted sheets,<br/>The muttering bip-bleeps<br/>Of mismatched types from one-night cheap cloud shells,<br/>All fluorescent glints in Telco hotels:<br/>Hallways that cut like layers in cake<br/>(Or quiche, it's with spinach they make)<br/>To lead you to an overwhelming question...<br/>Oh do not ask, "What format is it?"<br/>Join us, won't you, to delimit?</div>
