When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He wrote in bash, he wrote in monster bash
The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash
He did the bash, new lines end in a slash
He did the bash, he did the monster bash

From my laboratory near the castle's vane
To the master bedroom, where the AIs train
The neurals all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They wrote in bash, they wrote in monster bash
The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash
He did the bash, it will catch on more than flash
He did the bash, he did the monster bash

The oh-my-zsh-ers were having fun, the party began to uncork
The guests included *Man, Tabula and its forks

The scene was rockin', all were piping in sounds
Igor on a shell, running in background
The Bitwise Bangers were about to debut
With their vocal group, ""The Binary 10""

They wrote in bash, they wrote in monster bash
The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash
They did the bash, new lines end in a slash
They did the bash, they played the monster bash

Chiming from a window, Tabby's bell did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He crawled off the screen and shook his fist
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Terminal twist?""

It's now mbash, it's now the monster bash
The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash
They wrote in bash, new lines end in a slash
It's now mbash, it's now the monster bash

Now everything's cool, Tab's a part of the band
And my monster bash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this bash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Model A sent you

Then you can bash, then you can monster bash
The monster bash, control-c alt won't crash
Then you can bash, it will catch on more than flash
Then you can bash, then you can monster bash"

Long about a Saturday night
To dub-dub, gettin' ready to pub
Thinking everything was alright

Well, I set it up to pub, sent my key just like before
I pushed the packet with it
And I headed for the door, and then
Dot, slash! it undid my old path
Well how was I to know there was a proxy going on

They was a-slashing and back-slashing, reelin' with the feelin'
Rooting and re-rooting, routing and re-routing, yeah yeah

Bing bang, now the page just seems to hang
Devops from my living room rug, yeah
Tik-tak, we're shaving this yak
Oh my this is a the dancing bug

There was malloc lock with-a broken brew
GDAL and GIS GRASS was-a even missing, too
A-well-a, clear cache, that solved up the whole batch
I went and put my dancing shoes on, yeah

I was a slashing and back-slashing, reeling with the feeling
Rooting and re-rooting, routing and re-routing, yeah

Yes, I was a-slashing and back-slashing, I was encoding and decoding
Yeah, I was routing and re-routing, we was a-reeling with the feeling

Was a couple of guys who'd been friends since grad school
One was named Cyrus, the other was Jeff
And they refactored twice a week in Jeff's bedroom

The best ever jQuery plugin out of Newark
Never settled on a name
But the top three contenders after weeks of debate
Were Scrollr-Plus, and My-Plugin, and HTML-Clobber

Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts
They were headed for hack nights and moz fests and fortune and fame
So in script that made prominent use of a dollar sign
They stickered their laptops and keyboards with their tags

And this was how Cyrus got sent to the job
Where they told him he'd never do FOSS
And this was why Jeff, in the issues he'd file to his friend
Helped develop a plan to get even

When you punish a person for dreaming his dream
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you
The best ever jQuery plugin out of Newark
Will in time both outpace and outlive you

Hail Resig tonight

Stumbling through the Barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women

When everybody love you
Oh! Son, that's just about as funky as you can be

My smart phones and me
Starin' at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I'm wanna be just about as happy as I can be

Though I know that others' empires have lost all their band
Vanished from the LAN
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm buffering on repeat
I have latency to beat
And the crowd of lonely seats they won't stop streaming

My frames don't see a skip

Wait only for my new stores to be warming

Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly through the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's the same for everyone
And but for the life there are real lives showing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your cache control in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
Dancing across your mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that we're playing

Hey, this here Cache Control Plan, save this file for me
In the beepy boopy morning they'll come callin' for you

Take me disappearing through the akamais of mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
The muttering retreats
The cache caught up to see
To be our only seat
Far past a new conceit of real-time tomorrow
Yes, to be beneath the replicant eye
With one hand invalidate
Copying you and me
Circled by public demand
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Will this here Cache Control Plan, save a file for me

this new read on the title shows how much of a concept album wgs 1984 was meant to be. the branch from the first track ""won't you merge my fork"" is now showing its dark side as reality and aspirations collide.

t is ambiguous about whether she is using tabs or they are, choosing to keep questions open for the listener.

the fact that ""blank space"" ended up being about immature romance shows the strong commercial pressure the studio put on the piece.","Vices, habits, monokai"

The protagonist has been cut out from Kimbra's life because he has not kept up the pace of adoption — partly because he finds the level of information these apps require as being too invasive.","Now and then I think when all we had was Friendster
Like logging on you felt so creepy you could spy
Told myself that it wasn't right for me
But felt so lonely without company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of closeness
Like fascination with a trend, always a trend
So when you found that I could not keep up
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I just knew that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No I won't be signing up for Lo
Have your friends collect your records and then see you slumber

I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to Yo

Now you're just somebody that I used to Yo
Now you're just somebody that I used to Yo


Now and then I think of all the times you missed my postings
But had me believing it was always something your phone'd done
But I don't wanna relive my rave
Telling you every place I fave
You let your inner Luddite show
And I'll never get all hung up on somebody that I used to Yo

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No I won't be signing up for Lo
Have your friends collect your records and then see you slumber

Telling me just what a tool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
Showing up in a two-hop chart
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Chain, please tell me now does that seem wise
For you to read my heart based on contact size
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

The only girl I care about has gone away
Showing up in a two hop chart
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Chain, it will tell you that I love her so
Sending lovers' missives all of this you know
Reign in your chart and let the love we knew start to grow

Listening algorithms on the contact chain
Telling me just what a tool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

Oh, listen to the contact chain
Chitter chatter, chitter chatter
Oh, listen, listen to the contact chain
Chitter chatter, chitter chatter
Oh, listen, listen to the contact chain"

Concentratin' on tappin' right

And let the keys flutter

Well I looked then at my email chains
It all just seemed so much smaller
I said you've got to be jokin' man
I can make these somethin' other
I said I like it I want it
I roll it off my hands
And I am sorry, words crossed me
Without ever understanding uppercase
Like beautiful lace

Won't you please bring my library to me?

Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need transcriptions inbound
So serve me more my baby

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
AWS Turks die young, is he ready to go?
It's my last time running this form
But the drinks are free and the button is bold.

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of the ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

Young turks, young Saturday nights
Young eyes shouldn't stare just at bytes
Old flames to exist must ignite
So close the screen my baby

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
Got high HIT now all tasks are gold
It's my last time running this form
But the drinks are free and the button is bold.

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of the ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And every Turk I know

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
AWS Turks die young, is he ready to go?
It's not the last time running this form
Cause the hires come fast and friction is low.

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of the ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And every Turk I know"

That's the magic lumber
Yes it is
It's the magic lumber
Somewhere in the data/bass community
Was born tree - root, branch and leaf
And that's the magic lumber

(What does it all mean? )

Difficult parsing is seldom a pleasure
Pleasure and parsing starts from the root
Script that reconstructs a node graph is the measure
Measure out the branches, space to compute

Casually su but don't do in that role
'Cause suin' and doin' are actions for func keys
Doin' data hustle, no block or poll
Unless your name's ROOT_ERR, 'cause ROOT_ERR's too chunky

Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air
Criticising stacks shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the round-robin pairs
And don't get offended when place row-to-row's your daughter

A try-catch block and the loop is now set
Nodes get stored in a d.a.I.s.y. production
It stands for ""da inner source y'all"" and you can bet
Our action lasts a tick, not slowing the function

Everybody wants a tree in NodeJ
Everybody wants to nest in D3
But simple recurse is the best
And you don't have to guess
The C S V persists a tree
And that's the magic lumber"

My PATH got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the Prince of my MacBook Air.

In Shenzhen, China, assembled and praised
On the assembly line was where it spent most of its days
Bootin' up, brewin' super-rootin' all cool
Shootin' some sudo outside of school
When a couple of guys
Who were up to such guile
Startin' making trouble in my bash profile
They deleted one little colon, snickered and blared
They said: ""You'll never eye imports my cursed little Air.""

I pip'ed for my packages, kickin' the Mac into gear
But scripts runnin' errors sayin': ""Yo this package ain't here.""
If anything I can say is that this PATH's not aware
So I let's echo and vet it: ""I'll fix you my Air!""

I opened up my profile and saw about seven or eight folders running together.
I yelled to the screen: ""Yo homes, you must delimit!""
I re-saved my path.
My packages were finally there.
I sat on my throne as the Prince of my MacBook Air"

Not represent'ive no
Distribution all distorted yet
Darling, skewed left and lonely
When with the Poisson only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, log of it, do let, do let, do

Let's go slowly Bernoulli
Different from another coin-toss on your favorite silver dollar
This flip's pure randomness only, that's in the theory only
No, I gotta pick something else
These days a point comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes

Histomania
Skew left and see it grow
Like a binom- like a binomial
Fairly easily extended
Not hard to bin them all
From the peaks to the valleys

2013-04-17,T.S. Eliot,The Pathland,The Wasteland,,"path, brew, github, git, javascript, logs",,"April is the cruelest month, kneading
Knuckles onto keys, mixing
Cases and conventions, stirring
Dull roots that need sudo to brew.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Laps in heat sinks, feeding
A little life a few volts a time.
Summer surprised us, coming over the Hudson
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade
And went on in the sunlight, into the High-line park,
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
Bin gar keine Zeichner, stamm' aus Nachricht-Apps, echt Journalismus
And when we were interns, seeing the mayor's,
They took us shredding
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
Marie, hold on tight. And down papers went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
I code, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

What are the roots that access the shell, what branches grow
Out of this stony repo? Son of Octocat,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken aliases, where the path is faulty,
And the dead tree cries four-ô-four, the reset --hard gives no relief,
And the dry prompt blinking blinking, ready to tell you nothing was found. Only
There is a shadow to this blinking prompt
(Come in under the shadow of this blinking prompt),
And I will show you something different from either
The path in your shell pointing to your bash
Or the path in your the shell rising to zsh;
I will you show you news in a handful of binary.

""You gave me Mountain Lion first a year ago;
They called me Mountain Lion girl.""
--Yet when I booted up, late, from the Apple garden,
Your arms full, and your lips pursed, I could not scroll,
My gestures reversed, I was neither
hosting Sites nor at the beach, but beach balls spin,
Looking into the heart of rainbow's underworld twirling, the stillness.
Öd und leer der Windrad

Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
Had a bad cold, nevertheless
Is known to have the most abstract library in Europe,
With a wicked pack of functions. Here, said she,
Is your function, the drownedPhoenicianSailor

  var pearls = hisEyes.toPearls()

Here is Belladonna() // the Lady of the Rocks,
// The lady of situations.
Here is theManWithThreePipes(), and here theHowLoop(),
And here is theOneCommasCsv(), and this noop,
Which is blank, is something it extends,
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
theHangingLine(). Fear death by heap size.
I see crowds of memory, doubling every 18 months.
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
Tell her I bring the drive myself:
One must be so careful these days.

Unreal City,
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over Brooklyn Bridge, so many,
I had not thought Maps had misdirected so many,
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each one fixed his eyes before his screen.
Flowed up the hill and down Old Fulton Street,
To where Grimaldi's kept the hours
With a dead line on the stroke of them all.
There I saw one I knew and stopped him, crying ""Stetson!
You who were with me in the /etc at Etsy!
That worm you planted last year in the root,
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
Or has sudden vigilance disturbed its bed?

Oh keep the logs far hence, that'll reduce it to text,
With its reductions it'll dig it up!
You! hypocrite codeur! mon semblable, --mon frère!"

All mimsy were the headrares,
  And the fly parths outdades.

""Beware the Fixiewock, my son!
  The line strings that bite, the indents that catch!
Beware the Footnote bird, and shun
  The frumious Text-to-columns-snatch!""

He took his parsal Python in hand:
  Long time the text foe he sought --
So rested he by the RegEx tree,
  And stood awhile in UltraEdit.

And, as in csvish thought he stood,
  The Fixiewock, with special characters of lame,
Came whiffling through the hacky scraper,
  And errbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The parsal script went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its output
  He went piping back.

""And, has thou slain the Fixiewock?
  Come to my arms, my tired boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
  His values in his joy.

Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

Sweet is the breadth of pipes, her slender sweet,
With charm of subtle descender; pleasant the for

Its augmenting loops, on string, int, float and var,
Glist'ring with Monokai; flagrant the table's trends
After quick cleaning; and sweet the coming on
Of unique findings inspired; then silent study
With this its slalom pipes and this fair query,
And these the plots of heaven, her * train:
But neither breadth of pipes when they slender
With charm of subtle descender, nor looping for
On this delightful frame, nor string, float, var,
Glist'ring with Monokai, nor flagrance after cleaning,
Nor unique findings inspired, nor silent study
With this its slalom pipes, nor truth from query
Or glittering * light, without thee is sweet."

All fluorescent glints in Telco hotels:
